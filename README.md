## CNN Model For Food Quality Checking 🍓🍎
# Project Overview 
-> This project is primarily designed for an Online Food Delivery App🏢 to verify customer complaints about whether delivered food is fresh or stale.
 It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image processing.
 The application allows customers to upload an image of the food 🍋, and the web interface determines the quality of the food (fresh or stale).
 Based on the result, it helps verify whether the customer's complaint is valid ✅. Depending on the delivery company’s policy, appropriate actions 
 such as refunds 💰 or compensation can be taken.

 In simple terms, this application acts as a bridge between customers and food delivery platforms, ensuring transparency and fairness in complaint resolution.
