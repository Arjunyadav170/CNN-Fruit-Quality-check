## CNN Model For Food Quality Checking 🍓🍎
# Project Overview 
This project is primarily designed for an Online Food Delivery App to verify customer complaints about whether delivered food is fresh or stale.
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image processing.
The application allows customers to upload an image of the food, and the web interface determines the quality of the food (fresh or stale).
Based on the result, it helps verify whether the customer's complaint is valid. Depending on the delivery company’s policy, appropriate actions such as refunds or compensation can be taken.

In simple terms, this application acts as a bridge between customers and food delivery platforms, ensuring transparency and fairness in complaint resolution.
